# Microsoft Entra Samples

This repository contains sample scripts that leverage Microsoft Entra to manage identity and access in your environment. 

## Requirements

Before running the scripts, you'll need to install the following:

- Python 3.x
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)
- Requests library
- Microsoft Graph Python SDK

## Azure AD

### Identity Protection

#### Risky Users and Sign-In Activity Logs

The `risky_users_activity_logs.py` script uses the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve risky users and sign-in activity logs from Azure AD Identity Protection. 

To run the script, navigate to the `risky-users-activity-logs` directory and run the following command:

python risky_users_activity_logs.py

This will generate a CSV file with the risky users and their corresponding sign-in activity logs.
